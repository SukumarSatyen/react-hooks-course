# React Memo Tutorial

This project demonstrates the use of React hooks, particularly `useMemo`, for optimizing performance in a React application.

## Key Elements/Keywords

1. **React Hooks**: Functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

   - `useState`: A Hook that lets you add React state to function components.
     - "useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. [...] It returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it."
     - To manage 'data' and 'toggle' states in this component.

   - `useEffect`: A Hook for performing side effects in function components.
     - "The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components. [...] If you're familiar with React class lifecycle methods, you can think of useEffect Hook as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined."
     - To fetch data from an API when the component mounts.

   - `useMemo`: A Hook that memoizes expensive computations.
     - "useMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render."
     - To memoize the result of findLongestName function.

2. **Axios**: A popular, promise-based HTTP client for making requests.
   - To make a GET request to fetch data from an API.

3. **Conditional Rendering**: The ability to render different UI based on certain conditions.
   - To conditionally render an h1 element based on the 'toggle' state.

4. **Event Handling**: The method of running a function in response to an event.
   - Used in the onClick event of the Toggle button.

## Operations

1. Initial Component Mount:
   - The component is rendered for the first time.
   - 'data' state is initialized as null.
   - 'toggle' state is initialized as false.
   - useEffect hook triggers an API call to fetch comments.
   - useMemo initializes but doesn't compute (as data is null).
   - The component renders with an empty longest name and the Toggle button.

2. API Call Completion:
   - The API call completes and the response is received.
   - 'data' state is updated with the fetched comments using setData.
   - This state update triggers a re-render of the component.
   - useMemo now computes findLongestName with the new data.
   - The component re-renders, displaying the longest name.

3. Toggle Button Click:
   - User clicks the Toggle button.
   - setToggle is called, flipping the 'toggle' state.
   - This state update triggers another re-render.
   - useMemo checks its dependencies and sees that 'data' hasn't changed, so it doesn't recompute.
   - The component re-renders, potentially showing/hiding the "toggle" h1 element.

4. Subsequent Toggle Button Clicks:
   - Each click flips the 'toggle' state and causes a re-render.
   - useMemo continues to return the memoized value without recomputation.
   - Only the conditional rendering of the "toggle" h1 changes.

This demonstrates how useMemo optimizes performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculations of the findLongestName function when only the unrelated 'toggle' state changes.

## Usage

To use this component in your React project:

1. Install necessary dependencies (react, axios).
2. Copy the MemoTutorial component into your project.
3. Import and use the MemoTutorial component in your app.

Example:

```jsx
import MemoTutorial from './path/to/MemoTutorial';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <MemoTutorial />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This project serves as a practical example of using React hooks for state management and performance optimization.
